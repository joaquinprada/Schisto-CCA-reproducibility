# Schisto-CCA-reproducibility
Data and Scripts for the analysis of the reproducibility of CCA in two settings in Uganda. The analysis is presented in the manuscript by E. Kabbas-Pi√±ango et al., "Reproducibility matters: Intra- and inter-sample variation of the point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen test (POC-CCA) in high and low Schistosoma mansoni endemic areas in Uganda", 2023, under review  

Description of the Files:

-----
DataMayuge.csv contains the raw data from Mayuge. 
Kato-Katz data is coded as follows: KK_X_Y, where *X* codes the day (either 1, 2 or 3) and *Y* codes the repeat (either A or B). 
Point of Care Circulating Cathodic Antigen (POC-CCA) G-score is coded as follows POC_CCA_X, where *X* codes the day (either 1, 2 or 3). A subscript _dup2 and _dup3 indicates the second and third duplicate for each day.
